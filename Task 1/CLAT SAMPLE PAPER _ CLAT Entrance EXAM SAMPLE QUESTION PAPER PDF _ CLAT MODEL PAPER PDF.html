                        </h5>Coaching Institutions will do their job at best to guide you, but you must make an
                        effective study plan for your self-study if you want to crack <strong>CLAT.</strong> </p>
                        <p>Since Planning is the key to success, you must plan your study schedules to complete the
                            syllabus with every concept clear in your head before examinations.</p>
                        <p>But of course, you have to design workable and practical schedules. Set some weekly
                            schedules, plan for the subjects to complete within that week, and assign your time to them
                            accordingly. Try to focus more on chapters that have greater weightage in marks and study
                            them from time to time. Also, try to solve as many <strong> CLAT sample papers</strong> as

                        <p>Everyone has one or the other weak points, but smarter are the ones who work harder on their
                            weak areas and make it their strongest point.</p>

                            revise vocab which is difficult to remember at once.</p>

                            matters so keep that up and study again.</p>
