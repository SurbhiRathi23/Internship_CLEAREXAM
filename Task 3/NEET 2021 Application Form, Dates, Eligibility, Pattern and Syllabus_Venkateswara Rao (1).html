<br>
<p>NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) <strong>NEET 2021</strong>, the entrance exam conducted by NTA (National Testing Agency), is the eligibility-cum-ranking single entrance examination into MBBS/BDS UG courses. <strong>NEET 2021 exam date</strong> is expected to be in May 2021. For students to ace the exam, this page provides information on <strong>Neet syllabus 2021</strong>, pattern, and many important aspects. Basic <strong>Neet 2021 Syllabus</strong> in this post would give the much needed information.</p>
<p>Due to COVID, students may expect a delay in the notification, however, there are chances that aspects related to format, syllabus will be impacted. As CBSE had already reduced syllabus for Class XI and Class XII, students can expect few changes in the syllabus. But students are expected to have an high level idea to ace the examination and stand out among the competition.</p>

<p>NEET 2021 syllabus for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test NEET (UG)-2020 for admission to MBBS/BDS/BAMS/BSMS/BUMS/BHMS courses across the country.</p>
<p>The National Medical Commission of India (NMC) recommends the following syllabus for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test NEET(UG) for admission to MBBS/BDS/BAMS/BSMS/BUMS/BHMS courses across the country after review of various State syllabi as well as those prepared by CBSE, NCERT and COBSE. This is to establish a uniformity across the country keeping in view the relevance of different areas in medical education.</p>
<p>However, due to COVID, CBSE removed part of syllabus from the curriculum which would affect <strong>NEET 2021 syllabus</strong> as well. So for NEET syllabus 2021, it is expected that NTA would not include these parts in the core syllabus.</p>
<br>
